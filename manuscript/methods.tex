\section{Methods}

This work reviewed the international state of the art regarding dynamic 
facility deployment in \gls{NFC} simulators. It also investigated promising 
algorithmic innovations that have been successful for similar applications in 
other domains such as economics and industrial engineering.

At a high level, a meta-review of previous \gls{NFC} gap analyses 
\cite{stuff,stuff} helped to identify the existing simulators and their high 
level capabilities. In \cite{stuff}, the ability of some simulators to conduct 
transition scenarios is addressed, however the flexibility and performance of their varying 
algorithms for this capability are not addressed. 

Primary sources were consulted to determine the facility deployment logic present in the 
rest of the many \gls{NFC} simulators as well as the details of those methods.
