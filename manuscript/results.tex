\section{Results}
deployment models were categorized into into three categories: non optimizing 
(NO), deterministic-optimizing (DO), and stochastic-optimizing (SO). Among 
these, it characterizes performance (in terms of both compute speed and human 
effort), flexibility (in terms of the range of scenarios capably simulated), 
and robustness (in terms of consistent fidelity of the modeling results).
